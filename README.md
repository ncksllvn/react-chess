The UI for Underwater Chess

To run locally, you will need the [API](https://github.com/ncksllvn/chess-api) to be running locally as well, or edit the dev config
to use the public [API](http://api.underwaterchess.com). It is probably better you run it locally so that the public server
isn't bombarded.

Once the API is running, just run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Webpack should open your browser and get the whole thing going.
